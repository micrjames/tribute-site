			 <span id="tribute-info-heading">Here's a time line of his rise to technical dominance</span>
			 <ul id="tribute-info-timeline-list">
				<li id="tribute-info-timeline-list-item">
				   1942 - Born in Seattle, Washington.
				</li>
				<li id="tribute-info-timeline-list-item">
				   1967 - Receive Bachelor's degree in Mathematics with the intention of becoming a teacher. 
				</li>
				<li id="tribute-info-timeline-list-item">
				   1972 - Received a Ph.D. in Computer Science after becoming increasingly interested in technology. After receiving this degree, he fulfilled a draft obligation to the U.S. Navy by teaching at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS).
				</li>
				<li id="tribute-info-timeline-list-item">
				   1973 - He developed the first high-level programming language for microprocessors, PL/M. While working at Intel, he also wrote an 8080 instruction set simulator named INTERP/80. He created CP/M the same year to enable the 8080 to control a floppy drive, combining for the first time all the essential components of a computer at the microcomputer scale. He demonstrated CP/M to Intel, but Intel had little interest and chose to market PL/M instead.
				</li>
				<li id="tribute-info-timeline-list-item">
1974 - Kildall and his wife Dorothy established a company, originally called "Intergalactic Digital Research" (later renamed as Digital Research, Inc.), to market CP/M through advertisements in hobbyist magazines. Digital Research licensed CP/M for the IMSAI 8080. As more manufacturers licensed CP/M, it became a de facto standard. 
				</li>
				<li id="tribute-info-timeline-list-item">
				   1981 - CP/M ran on 3000 different computer models and DRI had US$5.4 million in yearly revenues.
				</li>
				<li id="tribute-info-timeline-list-item">
1980 - IBM approached Digital Research in 1980, at Bill Gates' suggestion,[13] to negotiate the purchase of a forthcoming version of CP/M called CP/M-86 for the IBM PC. Gary had left negotiations to his wife, Dorothy, as he usually did, while he and colleague and developer of MP/M operating system Tom Rolander used Gary's private aeroplane to deliver software to manufacturer Bill Godbout.[6][14] Before the IBM representatives would explain the purpose of their visit, they insisted that Dorothy sign a non-disclosure agreement. On the advice of DRI attorney Gerry Davis, Dorothy refused to sign the agreement without Gary's approval. Gary returned in the afternoon and tried to move the discussion with IBM forward, and accounts disagree on whether he signed the non-disclosure agreement, as well as if he ever met with the IBM representatives.[15]
